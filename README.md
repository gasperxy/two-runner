We will work on this project in a way that will be similar to how things are
done in "the real world". This means the core repository will be here, and you
will fork the repo to your own github profile, make your changes there in new
branches and issue pull requests. This will also give me the chance to review
the code and leave comments better.

We will also try to work through GitHub issues, so check there for more
information.

# Coding standards

We will adhere to the [Plone API coding
conventions](http://ploneapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute/conventions.html),
which are short and very useful. Read them!

# Editor

While the editor choice is left to you, I would recommend [Sublime Text
2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) for it's many and easily installable addons.
Tutorial on how to set ST2 up comming soon.
